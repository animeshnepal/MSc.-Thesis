\section{Background and motivation}
Nerochytic Speleogenesis (NERO)(Greek: nerochytis = sink), explained by \citet{Scherzer2017}, helps further in understanding the Karst process, where he states the density-driven \ce{CO2} dissolution from cave air enriches the Karst water with additional carbonic acid which expedites the karstification. It is hypothesized that there exists a concentration gradient of \ce{CO2} from vadose zone to phreatic zone which enriches the calcium-carbonate dissolution potential of the karstic water. With the seasonal fluctuations of \ce{CO2} concentrations, the rate of dissolution of \ce{CaCO3} is affected. Higher concentrations of \ce{CO2} during spring and summer means higher rate of dissolution of \ce{CaCO3} and lower rates during fall and winter, when the concentration of \ce{CO2} is at the lowest, as shown in \cref{tab:CO2fluctuations}.

\paragraph*{Density induced fingering}\mbox{}\\ \\
When the concentration of \ce{CO2} increases above the karst water, such as in summer, concentration gradient of \ce{CO2} from vadose to phreatic zone is established. According to Henry's Law, \ce{CO2} starts dissolving/diffusing into the karst water which causes the density of water to increase \cite{garcia2001density}, this in turn results in unstable layering of \ce{CO2} at the top of the water and after some onset time, protruding fingers of \ce{CO2} are triggered. As more \ce{CO2} is added into the water, more \ce{CaCO3} is dissolved and with the increase in density of water, the \ce{CO2}-enriched water is transported to depths and hence enhancing further dissolution of \ce{CaCO3} (the relevant chemical kinetics are discussed in \cref{chapter:modelconcept}, section \cref{sec:reactivesource}). The process is reversed during the winter, when the \ce{CO2} concentration in the cave air is lower than in cave water, as a result \ce{CO2} from the water diffuses out to the atmosphere resulting in precipitation of \ce{CaCO3}.\\ 

The thesis focuses on the dissolution of \ce{CO2} due to density induced fingering which facilitates the dissolution of \ce{CaCO3}, and we are concerned with the precipitating scenario. For that matter, gradient of \ce{CO2} in water is essential otherwise the fingering stops and so does dissolution of \ce{CaCO3}.

\paragraph*{\ce{CO2} movement}\mbox{}\\ \\
The protruding fingers of \ce{CO2} could be subjected to the background/base flow, which will have different outcomes depending on the velocity of the flow, which then regulate the diffusion of \ce{CO2} from the atmosphere into the karst water. Relatively small background flow means there exists protruding fingers of \ce{CO2} and if the flow is too strong, these fingers are suppressed, or consumed (in reality they are transported such that a fresh batch of karst water fills its spot and the gradient is preserved) such that the relevance of Nerochytic Speleogenesis is out of context. \\

This thesis focuses on explaining Nerochytic Speleogenesis; hence, we assume the density-fingering of \ce{CO2} either encounters no-background flow or relatively low background flow such that it does not suppress the fingers and that the chemical reactions at the wall consumes \ce{CO2}, in addition to the convective transport of \ce{CO2} in case of background flow.

\section {Research questions}
Starting with explaining the chemical kinetics involved in Nerochytic Speleogenesis, the thesis introduces a numerical model implemented in \DuMuX and explains the outcome of the simulations for different scenarios in order to answer some of the questions related to \ce{CO2}-driven speleogenesis.\\

\paragraph*{How much reaction is realistic?} What would be the realistic rate of dissolution of calcium-carbonate to have an impact on the environment? In an attempt to answer this question, we ran the simulation for varying scenarios and environmental constraints in \DuMuX. 

\paragraph*{What is the time scale for the rate of dissolution of calcium-carbonate?} On an immediate note after its plausibility check, we seek answer for the time scale of its occurrence. We expect this to be widely varying depending on the physical and chemical constraints.

\paragraph*{What are the limiting factors?} As mentioned above, this processes have limiting factors such as pH of the solution, Ca\textsuperscript{2+} concentration, \ce{CO2} concentration and its gradient, hydrostatic pressure, boundary conditions, etc.,  which will impact the process differently on its time-scale estimation and relevancy.
