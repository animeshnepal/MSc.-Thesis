I would like to express my deep and sincere gratitude to Holger Class for giving me the opportunity 
to conduct the thesis at the department LH\textsuperscript{2} and guiding me throughout the thesis. 
His insights into the subject were fundamental in making key decisions during the thesis. 
I also thank him for his trust in me on this task and for reminding me the big-picture, which 
served as a motivation for me to conduct this study, and at the same time helping me understand 
important details. \\

I would also like to thank Johannes Hommel who has been invaluable for this thesis to materialize. 
I was able to infer help from his dissertation to calculate and model the rate of dissolution of calcite. 
I would also like to thank Kilian Weishaupt for his help and time during online meetings in setting 
Fluid-system in DuMu\textsuperscript{x}, and for the model he developed for density-driven flow, 
which was my reference while implementing the model in DuMu\textsuperscript{x}. His help, together 
with Johannes, in understanding and rectifying the compiler errors while implementing the model in 
DuMu\textsuperscript{x} was crucial in finishing the thesis in the stipulated time.\\

I would like to thank Martin Schneider helping me setting up DuMu\textsuperscript{x} in VS Code 
and in running a debugger, which proved very handy in identifying and rectifying the errors in the code. \\
I would also like to thank Bernd Flemisch for his help in setting a git repository, which was essential 
to collaborate the work with different members.
