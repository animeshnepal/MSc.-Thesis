\chapter{Scenarios, Results and Discussions} \label{chapter:results}
\thispagestyle{empty}

A few scenarios were set, as shown in \cref{tab:scenarios}, in \DuMuX to address the 
research questions presented in chapter \ref{chapter:introduction}. Results we got 
from \MATLAB were also used to validate the results we got from \DuMuX for the closed system 
as shown in \cref{tab:scenarios}. For the validation purpose, identical initial 
and boundary conditions and a domain with just one cell of size [5mm$\times$15mm] were 
set in both \MATLAB and \DuMuX. \\

To set the scenarios, a few initial and boundary condition values -- such as flow-velocity, initial pH, boundary \ce{CO2} concentration -- were assumed. 
The primary goal of this thesis is to develop a model that implements reactive source and sink terms and understand 
the factors that affect the rate of calcite dissolution, so the veracity of assumed values are not of paramount importance in achieving the goal.\\

We chose a set of velocities for the protruding fingers by inferring the value from \citet{Class2020}. 
Although, the prominent value of pH in karst water is 6, we chose 7, 8 and 9 for comparing \DuMuX and 
\MATLAB results and understanding its dependency on the rate of dissolution and steady-state concentrations 
(hydrogen, carbonate, bicarbonate, calcium, and TIC). \\

\paragraph*{Grid grading}\label{para:definitionGridGrading} \mbox{} Grid grading parameters when set in the input file would refine the grid 
spacing targeting a certain portion of the domain and axis, but keeping the number of grids constant. 
The parameters are of special importance when there is a need to highly refine the grids to resolve a part 
of a bigger domain to closely estimate the variables of interest -- without these parameters, the total number 
of grids would rise manifold and so does the computational time without much of improvement in performance in 
the rest of the domain. \cref{fig:gridGrading} compares the effect of grid grading parameter. \\

According to Prandtl's Boundary layer theory \cite{anderson2005ludwig}, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:BL}
    \begin{aligned} \delta &\approx \begin{cases}\begin{aligned}
        &\frac{5.0x}{{Re^{1/2}}_x} &\textrm{laminar} \\ \\
        &\frac{0.16x}{{Re^{1/7}}_x} &\textrm{turbulent}\\
    \end{aligned}\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Reynolds number for the flow field along the wall:
\begin{equation}
Re_x = \frac{v_0x}{\nu} \\
\end{equation}

Reynolds number for open-channel flow \cite{french1985open}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} 
        Re_x & < 500 &\textrm{laminar} \\
        Re_x & > 12500 &\textrm{turbulent} \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

For the velocities 1mm/min, 0.5mm/min and 5mm/min, maximum wall length($x$) of 15mm, and kinematic viscosity($\nu$) of 
water at 10$^\circ$C 1.3063e-6 [$\mathrm{m^2/s}$] \cite{wagner2008iapws} boundary layer thickness was calculated using \cref{eq:BL}. 
Boundary layer thickness at the end of the wall for flow-velocity 1mm/min was calculated approximately equal to 170mm; 
for flow-velocity 5mm/min, it was 75mm; and for flow-velocity 0.5mm/min, it was 240mm. As discussed in the chapter 
\ref{chapter:numericalmodel}, subsection \ref{ssec:impdum}, we chose small domain as the primary goal of this thesis was to 
implement chemical kinetics of calcite dissolution and its coupling with the freeflow Navier-Stokes model. 
The width of the domain in the x-axis is just 5mm compared to the calculated boundary layer thickness, we were essentially 
inside the viscous region. Hence, we can expect nothing to very small differences in calculating the rate of calcite dissolution and concentration 
of primary variables when varying grid grading near the wall. To verify the model in \DuMuX is 
consistent with the mathematical calculation, we set the grid grading scenarios near the reactive wall as shown in \cref{fig:BL}. \\

\section{\DuMuX Simulation results}

\subsection{Time series plot: Open system}\label{ssec:timeSeriesOpen}
For an open system in \DuMuX, the model domain of size [5mm $\times$ 15mm] was divided into ten segments along the x-axis and twenty segments along the y-axis. 
\cref{fig:OpenedSystem} shows the model domain and boundary conditions set in \DuMuX for an open system scenario. 
A cell at the center of the reactive wall was selected to visualize the variation of a few variables (pH, $\mathrm{m^{Ca^{2+}}}$, $\mathrm{m^{TIC}}$, 
$\mathrm{m^{CO_3^{2-}}}$, $\mathrm{r_{diss}}$) in time.  
The calculation of source/sink terms in \DuMuX was invoked only at the reactive wall and for the rest of 
the domain, the governing equations without the source/sink term were solved. \\
Therefore, we chose a cell at the reactive wall to better understand the dissolution
and its dependency with the other variables. It could have been any cell at the wall, the values could also have been averaged over the cells at the wall, but we 
chose a center cell at the reactive wall, which was an arbitrary decision. The decision does not alter the derived conclusions from the plots below; the focus is on 
understanding the dependency rather than calculating a precise value for these variables (pH, $\mathrm{m^{Ca^{2+}}}$, $\mathrm{m^{TIC}}$, 
$\mathrm{m^{CO_3^{2-}}}$, $\mathrm{r_{diss}}$).

\subsubsection*{Different flow velocities}\label{ssec:diffFlowVel}
The flow-velocity/velocity of \ce{CO2} fingers was varied for this scenario. We assumed three different flow-velocities, 1mm/min, 0.5mm/min and 5mm/min, 
for simulation runs. We set the initial pH of the karst water to 6 but did not include a grid grading parameter in the input file. 
We set the initial concentration of TIC throughout the domain to 2.5e-7 [mol\_\ce{TIC}/mol\_\ce{H2O}], an assumed value, and the 
boundary condition at the top of the domain to 9.9956e-4 [mol/mol], a measured value at 8$^{\circ}$C and 1.0 atm pressure for a cave \cite{Class2020}. \\

     dissolution of calcite (\cref{fig:velrdiss}) in time for different flow velocities in an open system}
     \label{fig:comparisionDiffFlowVelocity}
\end{figure}

At the beginning of the simulation, the initial concentration of TIC, 2.5e-7 [mol/mol], triggered calcite dissolution. 
As the simulation proceeded, the dissolution potential, determined by the amount of carbonic acid, in the cell at the center of the reactive wall
got depleted which lowered the rate of calcite dissolution as shown in \cref{fig:velrdiss} and as a consequence increased the pH of the solution as shown in 
\cref{fig:velpH}. Meanwhile, flow-velocity carried atmospheric \ce{CO2} of concentration 9.9956e-4 [mol/mol], much higher 
than the initial concentration, into the solution. With the new batch of \ce{CO2} coming in, the depleted dissolution potential got recovered. \\

The faster the flow-velocity, the faster the replenishment of the depleted dissolution potential and 
higher the rate of dissolution, as seen in the \cref{fig:velrdiss}. Flow with higher velocity would bring \ce{CO2} into the solution at a faster rate; 
therefore, the solution would have more carbonic acid which acts as a fuel for dissolution. \cref{fig:velrdiss} shows flow-velocity with higher value
has a higher rate of dissolution at any given moment in time -- except for the initial few seconds when the rates of dissolution are equal since the 
initial TIC concentration is the only impetus for the calcite dissolution. \\

The faster the flow-velocity, the faster the system reaches steady-state. Steady-state would form an equilibrium between added acidity due to the 
transport of \ce{CO2} into the solution and the resultant alkalinity formed due to calcite dissolution. The higher the flow-velocity, 
the lower is the steady-state pH and higher is the steady-state concentration of calcium as shown in \cref{fig:velpH,fig:velmCa}.  
At the steady-state, dissociation reactions of calcite (also mentioned in \cref{chapter:LiteratureReview}) shifts more to the right 
forming \ce{Ca^{2+}}, \ce{HCO3^-}, \ce{CO3^{2-}} and \ce{H2O}. 
\begin{flalign*}
    & \ce{CaCO3 + H^+ <=> Ca^{2+} + HCO3^-}; & \\
    & \ce{CaCO3 + H2CO3 <=> Ca^{2+} + 2HCO3^-}; & \\
    & \ce{CaCO3 + H2CO3 <=> Ca^{2+} + CO3^{2-} + H2O .} &
\end{flalign*}

On the other hand dissociation reactions of carbonic acid shift more to the left forming carbonic acid and bicarbonate.
\begin{flalign*}
    & \ce{H2CO3 <=> H^+ + HCO3^-}, & \\
    & \ce{HCO3^- <=> H^+ + CO3^{2-}}. &
\end{flalign*}
Therefore, the steady-state concentration of carbonate decays to near zero as shown in \cref{fig:velmCO3}.


\subsubsection*{Different initial pH} \label{ssec:diffpH}

The initial pH of karst water was varied for this scenario. We assumed four different initial pH, 6, 7, 8, and 9, 
for simulation runs. We set the flow-velocity/velocity of \ce{CO2} fingers to 1mm/min but did not include grid grading 
parameter in the input file. We set the initial concentration of TIC throughout the domain to 2.5e-7 [mol\_\ce{TIC}/mol\_\ce{H2O}], 
an assumed value, and the boundary condition at the top of the domain to 9.9956e-4 [mol/mol], a measured value at 8$^{\circ}$C 
and 1.0 atm pressure for a cave \cite{Class2020}. \\

    dissolution of calcite (\cref{fig:pHrdiss}) in time for different initial pH in an open system}
    \label{fig:comparisionDiffInitialpH}
\end{figure} 


Unlike the scenario with different flow-velocity, it is safe to say that the rate of calcite dissolution and concentration of primary variables 
does not depend on the initial pH. 
Since we had different initial pH of the karst water, the pH and rate of dissolution plots (\cref{fig:pHpH,fig:pHrdiss}) look out of sync at the beginning but quickly adapts to identical values. 
As we saw in \cref{ssec:diffFlowVel}, the rate of calcite dissolution is strongly dependent on the flow-velocity and TIC concentration in the solution. 
Since these values (flow-velocity and TIC concentration in the solution) were constant in this scenario we did not see much differences in the plots. Initial 
inconsistency in the rate of dissolution and concentrations is because of the difference in the initial concentration of hydrogen which is used, together with TIC, 
to calculate carbonate and bicarbonate concentrations. 


\subsubsection*{Different boundary \ce{CO2} concentrations} \label{ssec:diffInitialBC}
The \ce{CO2} concentration at the top boundary was varied for this scenario. We assumed three different \ce{CO2} concentrations, 
1.5993e-6, 9.9956e-4, and 9.9956e-2 [mol/mol], for simulation runs. We set the flow-velocity/velocity of \ce{CO2} fingers to 1mm/min 
and initial pH to 6 but did not include grid grading parameter in the input file. We set the initial concentration of 
TIC throughout the domain to 2.5e-7 [mol\_\ce{TIC}/mol\_\ce{H2O}], which was an assumed value. \\

    dissolution of calcite (\cref{fig:CO2rdiss}) in time for different \ce{CO2} concentration at the top of the domain in an open system}
    \label{fig:diffCO2}
\end{figure}

Similar to the scenario in \cref{ssec:diffFlowVel} the initial concentration of TIC, 2.5e-7 [mol/mol], triggered calcite dissolution. 
But unlike the scenario in \cref{ssec:diffFlowVel}, now the flow-velocity entering the domain carries different concentrations of \ce{CO2}. 
The higher the concentration of \ce{CO2} in the incoming water, the higher is the elevation of dissolution potential of the karst water and, consequently, higher is 
the calcite dissolution and concentration of TIC, as shown in \cref{fig:CO2rdiss,fig:CO2mCa,fig:CO2mTIC}. \\

The higher concentration of \ce{CO2} in the incoming water produces a higher concentration of carbonic acid which decreases the pH of 
the solution (\cref{fig:CO2pH}). The rate of calcite dissolution decreases for the \ce{CO2} concentration
of 1.5993e-6 [mol/mol] as it reaches the steady-state which shifts the dissociation reactions of calcite more to the left. 
On the other hand dissociation reactions of carbonic acid shift more to the right forming carbonate and bicarbonate. 
\cref{fig:CO2mCO3} illustrates the concentration of carbonate higher for the lowest among the other two concentrations of \ce{CO2}.


\subsubsection*{Different Grid grading parameter} \label{ssec:diffGrid}

The grid grading parameter was varied for this scenario. We assumed three different grid grading values, 
1.0 (without grid grading), 1.1 and 1.2, for simulation runs. We set the flow-velocity/velocity of \ce{CO2} fingers to 1mm/min 
and initial pH to 6. We set the initial concentration of TIC throughout the domain to 2.5e-7 [mol\_\ce{TIC}/mol\_\ce{H2O}], 
an assumed value, and the boundary condition at the top of the domain to 9.9956e-4 [mol/mol], a measured value at 8$^{\circ}$C 
and 1.0 atm pressure for a cave \cite{Class2020}. \\

\cref{fig:diffGrid} helps in comparing the numerical model with the mathematical model presented in \cref{para:definitionGridGrading}
for the resolution of a boundary layer near the wall. \\

\end{figure}

\cref{fig:diffGrid} confirms with the mathematical calculation we had for our model that there are only minor differences 
in calculating the rate of calcite dissolution and concentration of primary variables when varying grid grading near the wall. 
The plots are a little out of sync at the beginning of the simulation. A higher grid grading would mean a smaller domain size near 
the reactive wall. Therefore, a smaller domain would have a faster depletion of carbonic acid and a faster rise in pH as shown in \cref{gridpH} but 
as soon as the depleted potential gets replenished with additional transported \ce{CO2} pH along with the rate of dissolution and concentration of 
$\mathrm{m^{Ca^{2+}}}$, $\mathrm{m^{TIC}}$ and $\mathrm{m^{CO_3^{2-}}}$ adapts to identical values. 

\subsection{Contour plots: Open System} \label{ssec:contour}
For an open system in \DuMuX, steady-state contour plots for a model domain of size [5mm $\times$ 15mm] are presented and explained in this subsection.
The model domain has, as in \ref{ssec:timeSeriesOpen}, ten segments along the x-axis and twenty segments along the y-axis. We saw in \ref{ssec:diffFlowVel}
the rate of calcite dissolution and concentrations of primary variables depend strong on flow-velocity and the boundary/initial \ce{CO2} concentration. 
The flow-velocity/velocity of \ce{CO2} fingers was varied for this scenario. \\
We set the initial pH of the karst water to 6 and set the grid grading to 1.1 in the input file. 
We set the initial concentration of TIC throughout the domain to 2.5e-7 [mol\_\ce{TIC}/mol\_\ce{H2O}], an assumed value, and the 
boundary condition at the top of the domain to 9.9956e-4 [mol/mol], a measured value at 8$^{\circ}$C and 1.0 atm pressure for a cave \cite{Class2020}. \\
We assumed three different flow-velocities, 1mm/min, 0.5mm/min and 5mm/min, for simulation runs to understand the steady-state spatial distribution of 
pH, $\mathrm{m^{Ca^{2+}}}$, $\mathrm{m^{TIC}}$ and $\mathrm{m^{CO_3^{2-}}}$. 
All the plots in this subsection were obtained from Paraview \cite{ahrens2005paraview}.

    \caption{\DuMuX Contour plots: Numerical results that show the distribution of pH at the steady-state in an open system}
     \label{fig:contourpH}
\end{figure}

All the \cref{fig:pHSteady-state,fig:pHSteady-state5mm,fig:pHSteady-state0.5mm} show higher pH near the reactive wall 
where carbonic acid is used up in calcite dissolution to form carbonate, bicarbonate, and calcium. 
As we go away from the wall, pH decreases gradually as the concentration of carbonic acid in the solution increases . 
The steady-state pH is a composite of carbonic acid and carbonate, bicarbonate, and calcium. Carbonic acid depends on the amount of \ce{CO2} 
transported into the karst water, so, without calcite dissolution, there would be no spatial variation of pH rather some value less than 6. 
On the one hand the products from calcite dissolution (carbonate, bicarbonate, and calcium) slowly get diffused into the system which 
increases the pH but on the other hand the products also get carried 
out of the system with the flow-velocity which would again increase the pH. The farther we go from the wall, the less pronounced is the diffusion 
and ultimately after some distance, the flow-velocity wins over diffusion. \\

A higher flow-velocity means diffusion of carbonate, bicarbonate, and calcium into the system is suppressed; hence, much of the domain would be 
just carbonic acid, as shown in \cref{fig:pHSteady-state5mm}.

Similar to \cref{fig:contourpH}, all the \cref{fig:CO3Steady-state,fig:CO3Steady-state5mm,fig:CO3Steady-state0.5mm} show higher 
carbonate concentration near the reactive wall where carbonic acid is used up in calcite dissolution to form carbonate, bicarbonate, and calcium. 
As described in \cref{sssec:contourpH}, the spatial distribution is a resultant of flow-velocity with which \ce{CO2} is transported into the system, which 
also dictates calcite dissolution, and diffusion of the products formed during dissolution.

     \label{fig:contourTIC}
\end{figure}

Total inorganic carbon comprises of \ce{CO2}, \ce{H2CO3}, \ce{CO3^{2-}} and \ce{HCO3^-}. As we described in previous subsections, 
carbonic acid dissolves calcite forming carbonate, bicarbonate, and calcium into the solution. Concentrations of carbonate, bicarbonate, and calcium 
gradually decrease as we go away from the wall and, consequently, the concentration of carbonic acid (\ce{H2CO3}) gradually increases. 
In all of these concentrations (carbonate, bicarbonate, and carbonic acid) change, the total inorganic carbon remains constant, as shown in \cref{contourTIC}.
The spatial distribution of total inorganic carbon in steady-state does not depend on the flow-velocity.

Similar to \cref{fig:contourpH,fig:contourCO3}, all the \cref{fig:CaSteady-state,fig:CaSteady-state5mm,fig:CaSteady-state0.5mm} show higher 
calcium concentration near the reactive wall where carbonic acid is used up in calcite dissolution to form carbonate, bicarbonate, and calcium. 
The explanation to the spatial distribution is exactly the same as described in \cref{sssec:contourpH,sssec:contourmCO3}.


\subsection{Time series plot: Closed system} \label{ssec:timeSeriesClosed}
For a closed system in \DuMuX a model domain of size [5mm $\times$ 15mm] was divided into ten segments along the x-axis and twenty segments along the y-axis.
A cell at the center of the reactive wall was selected to visualize the variation of a few variables (pH, $\mathrm{m^{Ca^{2+}}}$, $\mathrm{m^{TIC}}$, 
$\mathrm{m^{CO_3^{2-}}}$, $\mathrm{r_{diss}}$) in time, similar to the setup described in \cref{ssec:timeSeriesOpen}.

\subsubsection*{Different initial pH} \label{ssec:diffinitialpHnoflow}
The initial pH of karst water was varied for this scenario. We assumed four different initial pH, 6, 7, 8, and 9, 
for simulation runs. We did not include the grid grading parameter in the input file. We set the initial concentration of TIC throughout the domain to 
2.5e-7 [mol\_\ce{TIC}/mol\_\ce{H2O}], an assumed value.\\

    and rate of dissolution of calcite (\cref{fig:withoutpHrdiss}) in time for different initial pH in a closed system}
    
    \label{fig:comparisionWithoutDiffInitialpH}
\end{figure}

As we know from \ref{ssec:timeSeriesOpen}, the rate of calcite dissolution and concentration of primary variables 
does not closely depend on the initial pH. Since we had different initial pH of the karst water, the pH and rate of 
dissolution plots (\cref{fig:withoutpHpH,fig:withoutpHrdiss}) look out of sync at the beginning, just 
like \cref{fig:pHpH,fig:pHrdiss} but quickly adapts to identical values. 
Unlike in an open system, carbonic acid -- fuel for dissolution of calcite -- in a closed system does not get replenished since 
the boundaries are closed to the external environment. As the dissolution proceeds due to the initial concentration 
of TIC present in the water, carbonic acid gets depleted and slowly but surely the rate of calcite dissolution comes to naught (\cref{fig:withoutpHrdiss}). \\

Carbonic acid near the vicinity of the wall is used up for calcite dissolution. Carbonic acid farther away from the wall reaches the wall by 
diffusion, the only transport mechanism in a closed system. Because of the diffusion, it takes substantial time for 
the rate of calcite dissolution to cease as shown in (\cref{fig:withoutpHrdiss}). Consequently, the change in concentration of TIC and carbonate 
is gradually decreasing and it stabilizes when the dissolution eventually ceases as shown in \cref{fig:withoutpHmTIC,fig:withoutpHmCO3}.


\subsubsection*{Different Grid grading parameter} \label{ssec:diffGridnoflow}
The grid grading parameter was varied for this scenario. We assumed three different grid grading values, 
1.0 (without grid grading), 1.1 and 1.2, for simulation runs. We set the initial pH of water to 6 and 
the initial concentration of TIC throughout the domain to 2.5e-7 [mol\_\ce{TIC}/mol\_\ce{H2O}], 
an assumed value. \\

\cref{fig:comparisionWithoutDiffgrid} confirms with the mathematical calculation we had for our model that there are only minor differences 
in calculating the rate of calcite dissolution and concentration of primary variables when varying grid grading near the wall, 
the same conclusion we had in \cref{ssec:diffGrid}. 


\section{\MATLAB Simulation results: Closed system}
The scenario we had in \DuMuX for a closed system, where diffusion would mix all the components in water throughout the domain, 
had multiple cells, but in \MATLAB we only have one cell which causes the components in the water to mix instantly. \\

\MATLAB results (\cref{fig:MATLABcomparisionDiffInitialpH}) look very similar to the \DuMuX results (\cref{fig:comparisionWithoutDiffInitialpH}) 
for a closed system with varying initial pH as described in \cref{ssec:ssec:diffinitialpHnoflow}. Instant mixing of components throughout the domain 
in the \MATLAB model results in a faster approach to steady-state. In \DuMuX it was diffusion that mixed the components throughout the domain. \\

The higher the initial pH, the lower is the initial rate of calcite dissolution, since the basic solution slows down the calcite dissociation 
as shown in \cref{fig:withoutvelpH,fig:withoutvelrdiss}.

\section{Comparison: \DuMuX and \MATLAB} \label{sec:dvm}
Identical initial and boundary conditions and a domain with just one cell of size [5mm$\times$15mm] were set in both \MATLAB and \DuMuX 
to carry out the comparison. The initial pH of karst water and the reactive area/batch volume were varied to compare the results. 
For a 2D domain, a reactive area is defined as the length of the reactive wall and a batch volume is the area of the cell where dissolution occurs. 
We assumed four different initial pH (6, 7, 8, and 9), and three different reactive area/batch 
volume (5mm/5\ce{mm^2}, 15mm/75\ce{mm^2}, and 30mm/300\ce{mm^2}) for simulation runs. We set the initial concentration of TIC 
throughout the domain to 2.5e-7 [mol\_\ce{TIC}/mol\_\ce{H2O}], 
an assumed value. \cref{fig:ClosedSystem} shows the model domain and boundary conditions set in \MATLAB and \DuMuX for this scenario. \\

\cref{tab:DumuxVsMatlab} shows \MATLAB results agree closely with \DuMuX results at the steady-state. A slight disagreement in the steady-state time is 
because of the difference in the time step size between the two models. \\
