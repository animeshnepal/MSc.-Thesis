\chapter{Numerical Model}\label{chapter:modelconcept}
\thispagestyle{empty}

The numerical model for CO\textsubscript{2} density-driven dissolution in water was developed by \citet{Class2020}. As part of the thesis, we added source and sink terms in the continuity equation to the  model implemented by \citet{Class2020} for modeling dissolution of calcite. We implemented a reactive source and sink term in the model, and for this we sought help from \citet{hommel2016modeling} dissertation. A fluid system was created to suit one phase (liquid), three components (\ce{H2O, \ce{CO2}} and calcium). Fluid systems in \DuMuX explain the thermodynamic properties of quantities (in our model, the quantities are \ce{H2O, CO2} and calcium) and its relationship with each another. A two-dimensional model domain [5mm $\times$ 15mm] was setup in \DuMuX to run the simulation.

\section{Solving the reactive model}
Two tools were used to model the calcite dissolution: \MATLAB and \DuMuX. \MATLAB allowed easy testing of the calcite dissolution model we envisaged without the overhead of \DuMuX.

\paragraph*{\MATLAB} was used to model calcite dissolution. We solved charge balance equation (eq. \ref{eq:chargebalfinal}) to calculate the rate of calcite dissolution; and steady-state concentration of hydrogen (pH), carbonate and bicarbonate, calcium, and total inorganic carbon. we considered batch volume approach having only one cell of size [5mm$\times$15mm], the same model size as in \DuMuX, which would make the dissolved products to instantly mix throughout the domain as the dissolution proceeds. In \MATLAB we solved for closed system with no outflow or inflow of calcium, \ce{CO2} and water. We set an initial concentration of total inorganic carbon throughout the domain and started the simulation with an initial pH. We varied the initial pH, as mentioned in \cref{tab:scenarios}, to understand its dependency on the rate of dissolution and steady-state concentrations (hydrogen, carbonate, bicarbonate, calcium and TIC). The results that we got from \MATLAB were also used to validate the results from \DuMuX, as we set an identical initial and boundary conditions and a domain with just one cell of size [5mm$\times$15mm] as in \DuMuX to mimic the batch volume approach adopted in \MATLAB. We expect the results to be identical from the \MATLAB and \DuMuX models. \\

\paragraph*{\DuMuX} In \DuMuX, continuity equation \ref{eq:contiEq} was solved together with source and sink terms accounting for \ce{CO2} and calcium. A few batch scenarios with varying parameters, such as Initial pH, reactive-area/batch volume (if it's an closed system), flow-velocity (if it's an open system), \ce{CO2} concentration at the cave above the karst water (if it's an open system) and grid grading parameter (\ref{chapter:results}) were setup in \DuMuX as illustrated in \cref{tab:scenarios}. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Closed System: In order to make a plausible comparison with the \MATLAB results, the top and bottom boundary conditions were set to Neumann no-flow for the fluxes across the boundary. Batch volume approach having only one cell of size [5mm$\times$15mm] was adopted similar to the model setup in \MATLAB. Initial pH, and reactive-area/batch-volume were varied to understand its dependency on the rate of dissolution and steady-state concentrations (hydrogen, carbonate, bicarbonate, calcium and TIC).\\
    Grid grading parameter was also varied, a different setup which was not considered in comparing the results with \MATLAB (\MATLAB only has one cell), but the system's still closed which has 10 grids in x-direction and 20-grids in y-direction. 
    \item Open system: Neumann no-flow boundary conditions were lifted, the number of grids is 10 in x-direction and 20 in y-direction, and  protruding \ce{CO2} fingers into the karst water were set to model cave scenario. Initial pH, flow-velocity, \ce{CO2} concentration at the cave above the karst water and grid grading parameter were varied to understand its dependency on the rate of dissolution and steady-state concentrations (hydrogen, carbonate, bicarbonate, calcium and TIC).
\end{enumerate}


\section{Implementation in \MATLAB}
Varying initial pH of the solution, and reactive-area/batch-volume; the rate of dissolution and steady-state time and concentrations of hydrogen, carbonate, bicarbonate, calcium and TIC were calculated. \cref{eq:rDiss, eq:omega} were solved to calculate rate of calcite dissolution (\ce{r_{diss}}). Rate of calcite dissolution when multiplied with the reactive-area and the time-step would give the amount of produced \ce{CO2} and calcium. With the increase in calcium concentration in the solution, total inorganic carbon would also increase by the same amount (\ce{m^{TIC}} = $\mathrm{m_{initial}^{TIC}}$ + \ce{m^{\ce{Ca^{2+}}}}). Charge balance equation \ref{eq:chargebalfinal} was solved for concentration of hydrogen ($\mathrm{m^{H^{+}}}$) with the updated concentrations of calcium and total inorganic carbon. The charge balance equation \ref{eq:chargebalfinal} is a non-linear equation in $\mathrm{m^{H^+}}$. We used \MATLAB function "vpasolve", a non-linear solver, to solve \cref{eq:chargebalfinal} for $\mathrm{m^{H^+}}$. With the new concentration of hydrogen, rate of dissolution was calculated again for the next time-step and the cycle is repeated until it reaches the end of simulation. A flowchart is presented in \cref{fig:flowchartMATLAB} to show the work flow.

\section{Implementation in \DuMuX}\label{ssec:impdum}
The numerical simulator \DuMuX helps us to solve complex differential equations as we encounter in free/porous medium flow. We use the \textit{freeflow Navier-Stokes model} in \DuMuX and employ \textit{h2oco2calcium} fluid system. The fluid-system had one phase (liquid phase) and three components (\ce{H2O, CO2, calcium}). We only considered density of water in calculating density of fluid. We also switched off the gravity and we assumed a constant hydro-static pressure throughout the domain. Although for modeling bigger geological systems, gravity cannot be switched off as there will be significant rise in the pressure as the depth increases. We used a staggered-grid, finite volume method for solving primary variables in every control volumes. All equations are solved implicitly using a Newton solver. The Newton solver adapts the time step size depending on the convergence of the solution and is limited by a user-controlled maximum time-step size. For further information on discretization, numerical methods and it's implementation, refer to \cite{Koch2020} or the handbook of \DuMuX \cite{Kochetal2020Dumux}.

\subsection*{Primary variables} Pressure and concentration  of \ce{CO2}, calcium and \ce{H2O}, three scalar variables, in terms of mole fraction as well as the velocity vector were selected as primary unknowns. 

\subsection*{Boundary conditions} 
The velocity vector ($\mathbf{v}$), pressure (p) and the concentrations of \ce{CO2} and calcium are set to Dirichlet values; and \ce{H2O}, \ce{CO2} and calcium fluxes are set to Neumann values in the NS-model. We had two setups in \DuMuX i.e., open and closed systems, and boundary conditions were different for these two setups.

\paragraph*{Open system} \mbox{} \\

As shown in \cref{fig:OpenSystem}, we set Dirichlet condition at the top boundary for velocities in x and y directions and concentration of \ce{CO2} and calcium. For the left boundary, we assumed no-slip condition as we set Dirichlet condition for velocities and Neumann condition for \ce{CO2} and calcium fluxes. Similarly for the bottom boundary, we set Dirichlet condition for pressure and Outflow conditions for \ce{CO2} and calcium fluxes formed due to the dissolution of calcite. we set a symmetric property at the right boundary instead of assigning identical boundary condition as to the left which also reduced the computational time.

    \label{fig:OpenSystem}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}


\paragraph*{Closed system} \mbox{} \\
As shown in \cref{fig:ClosedSystem}, we set Dirichlet condition at the top boundary for velocities in x and y direction and Neumann no-flow for concentration of \ce{CO2} and calcium fluxes. For the left boundary, we assumed no-slip condition -- similar to the open system -- as we set Dirichlet condition for velocities and Neumann condition for \ce{CO2} and calcium fluxes. On the bottom boundary, we set Dirichlet condition for pressure and Neumann no-flow for concentration of \ce{CO2} and calcium fluxes. we also set a symmetric property at the right boundary -- again, similar to the open system. Hence, the only difference between these two setups was the the top and bottom boundary condition.

    \caption{Model domain and boundary conditions for \ce{CaCO3} dissolution in a closed system}
    \label{fig:ClosedSystem}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}
 

\subsection*{Source/Sink term} A function, \code{reactionSource()}, was implemented which calculates the added concentration of \ce{CO2} and calcium into the solution because of dissolution of calcite. On the one hand addition of \ce{CO2} in karst water in an open system  will form carbonic acid which will reduce the pH, on the other hand addition of carbonic acid replenishes dissolution potential of the karst water, thereby enhancing dissolution of calcite forming carbonates and bicarbonates which will increase the pH. Therefore, steady-state is expected to be dependent on the flow-velocity with which \ce{CO2} is being carried into the karst water from the atmosphere adjusting to new acidity and a consequence alkalinity.

% comment on the literature on how this can be achieved

\subsection*{Solving reaction equation} A function,\code{setValues()}, calls \code{calculateValues\_()} function that solves the charge balance equation (\ref{eq:chargebalfinal}) for a given time step throughout the domain and saves the calculated values to a vector. The saved values was then retrieved and used for visualization in paraview. The function \code{reactionSource()} needs molality of hydrogen ($\mathrm{m^{H^+}}$), which is already calculated and stored in a vector, to calculate the added concentration of \ce{CO2} and calcium into the solution due to dissolution of calcite. \\
The charge balance equation was solved for $\mathrm{m^{H^+}}$ using Brent's algorithm \citet{brent1971algorithm} -- a non-linear solver for finding root of scalar functions.
